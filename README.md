# Code for the Simulation Protocol

This repository includes scripts for simulating the protocol described in the supplementary material:

s1_learning_model_prescreen_z_ll_m.R: This script corresponds to Step 1 in Section 2.1.1 ("Parameter Recovery with Simulation"). It is used for prescreening the learning model.

s2_learning_model_param_recov_z_ll_m.R: This script pertains to Step 2 in Section 2.1.1 ("Parameter Recovery with Simulation"). It focuses on parameter recovery for the learning model.

s3_cal_lik_diff_bet_two_models.R: This script is referenced in Section 2.2 ("Distinguishing the Two Decision Models"). 

s4_model_pred_LOOCV.R: This script is used for Section 2.4.3.2 ("Model Prediction with Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)") in the manuscript. It performs model predictions using LOOCV methodology.

Feel free to explore the scripts for detailed insights into the simulation processes.
